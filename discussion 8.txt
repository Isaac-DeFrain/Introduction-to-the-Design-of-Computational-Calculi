Comparing Processes:

Structural equivalence
  abstract away parts of our syntax
  that differentate processes in ways we weren't intending

Bisimulation
  Gives you a way to say what portion of your process you wish to
  observe (these are called barbs)
  
  In the example of the N-barbed bisimulation these are outputs on a
  set of names

Reduction Congruence
  If I drop a process in a context, does it behave "the same"
  (which can still be defined via our barbs or observation relation)


x!(*z) | z!(*z)
...is {x,y}-barbed bisimilar to
x!(*y) 

But is not reduction congruent
Consider the context:

[] | z(q).y!(*q)

( x!(*z) | z!(*z) ) | z(q).y!(*q)
...reduces to
x!(*z) | y!(*q)
...which is observable at x and y

But
x!(*y) | z(q).y!(*q)
...is never observable at y
